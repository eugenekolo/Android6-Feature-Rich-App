Originally built for CS591 at Boston University.

Features include:
* Several common GUI features (i.e. spinner, toasts, lists, buttons, swipe, etc.)
* Send SMS through the phone
* Look up phone contacts
* Geofencing

* Interact with Twitter web API
* Interact with Google Places web API

**Note: The app won't actually run w/o API keys set back into place. Search for "XXX_FILL_ME_XXX" occurences
and replace with correct API keys instead.**
